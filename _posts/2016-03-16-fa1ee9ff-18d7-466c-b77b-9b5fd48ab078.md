••strange New UBER logo 2016-02-02••   
• timeline compilation by jungelrolf@me.com   
• inspired in-house by "bits and atoms" (co-founder Travis Kalanick's 2013 blog post)   
• Riders logo = circle with a square in the middle (riders)   
• Drivers logo = Hexagon with a square in middle (drivers) 

• Why change, why now, why so strange?   
Excuse:   
1\. reflect "transportation network"   
2\. old logo was just "black & white, somewhat distant & cold"   
3\. background patterns match country's + city's culture
